# PLANS / TODO'S:

    - Add prop-types to PreviewRef -> no crashing when adding new category!!!
    - Include basic Routing to List of references
    - Add some kind of visual representation? Maybe it is more important to work on the other things though, since this is only a test
    - Add Preview Pane for referenced docList
    - Add Links to docs & guides -> Better to understand 

## this is very much a work in progress and playground

Feel free to add to it.

### PreviewRef, category for Reference Preview 

### Adding Routing is somehow done in "MyTool" Plugin

But I don't yet understand how it works under the hood, so this will take a lower prio. If you understand it: add to this repo but PLEASE comment like a maniac!
