# PLANS / TODO'S

:checkmark_white: These are the next Steps (Saskia):

- Add prop-types to PreviewRef -> no crashing when adding new category!!!
- Include basic Routing to List of references
- Add some kind of visual representation? Maybe it is more important to work on the other things though, since this is only a test
- Add Preview Pane for referenced docList
- Add Links to docs & guides -> Better to understand

## this is very much a work in progress and playground :pencil:

Feel free to add to it.

### PreviewRef, category for Reference Preview :eyes:

- [components/PreviewRef](https://github.com/bobinska-dev/costom-input-component/blob/master/components/PreviewRef.js)

- [schemas/category.js](https://github.com/bobinska-dev/costom-input-component/blob/master/schemas/category.js)

### Adding Routing is somehow done in "MyTool" Plugin :bulb:

But I don't yet understand how it works under the hood, so this will take a lower prio. If you understand it: add to this repo but PLEASE comment like a maniac!
