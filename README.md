# PLANS / TODO'S:
    * Add prop-types to PreviewRef -> no crashing when adding new category!!!

    * Include basic Routing to List of references

    * Add some kind of visual representation? Maybe it is more important to work on the other things though, since this is only a test

    * Add Preview Pane for referenced docList

    * Add Links to docs & guides -> Better to understand 

## this is very much a work in progress and playground
Feel free to add to it
